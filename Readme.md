*Autonomous Unified Reasoning Operations for Resource Acquisition*

**A Comprehensive AI/ML/DL Framework for Cognitive Source-to-Pay Operations**

## üéØ Project Vision: The AURORA Awakening

AURORA represents the dawn of a new era in procurement intelligence. Transform your Source-to-Pay process into a **self-learning, self-optimizing AI ecosystem** where autonomous agents leverage the complete spectrum of AI technologies - from traditional ML to cutting-edge deep learning - to make intelligent decisions, predict outcomes, and continuously evolve their cognitive capabilities.

**AURORA** isn't just automation - it's **cognitive augmentation** that thinks, learns, and adapts like a digital procurement expert that never sleeps.
